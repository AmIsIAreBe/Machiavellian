Hey there, this is the project files for a 2d video game called Machiavellian.
It is built in unity and has one functioniong level in a nearly finished state
as well as scraps of a second level very incomplete.  The project has bee nmanaged
with Visual Studio Team services, I've uploaded a copy to github for resume purposes.
