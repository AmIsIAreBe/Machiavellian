Hey there, this is the scripts from the project files for a 2d video game called Machiavellian. 

It is built in unity and coded in C#. The game has one functioning
level in a nearly finished state,as well as scraps of a second level very incomplete.

The project has been managed with Visual Studio Team services, I've uploaded a copy to github for resume purposes.
